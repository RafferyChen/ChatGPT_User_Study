# Welcome to the Chat-GPT User Study
## Introduction
Thank you for joining us in this experiment. Our research goal is to assess the effectiveness of Chat-GPT in assisting students of varying coding proficiency in understanding concepts and completing coding tasks. Your participation is invaluable in contributing to this research.

## Consent Form
Before we begin, it is essential for all participants to read and sign the consent form. This form outlines the details of the study, including your rights and our commitment to your privacy and data protection.

## Pre-Study Survey

Please take a moment to fill out the pre-study survey. This survey is designed to gather initial information about your background and coding proficiency, which is crucial for our research analysis.

## Experiment Setup
The experiment is divided into the following parts:

### Video Presentation
Watch a Computer Science concept video from YouTube.

### Coding Task
Solve a LeetCode-style coding question related to the video topic. Half of the participants hava to use and only use ChatGPT for assistance, while the other half can access online resources such as Java documentation, StackOverflow, GitHub, etc.

### Task Guidelines
- Thoroughly read and understand the coding task question prompt.
- Feel free to ask any clarifying questions.
- You will have a 20-minute window to complete each task.
- Your screen will be recorded during the task.
- Test cases will be provided for you to use in debugging your code.
- If using ChatGPT, you can ask for any form of assistance.
