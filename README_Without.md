# Welcome to the Computer Science Concepts User Study
## Introduction
Thank you for joining us in this experiment. Our experiment is designed as a simulation of the learning process in computer science education. We want to evaluate how effectively traditional online resources support learning and understanding of new concepts. Your participation is invaluable in contributing to this research.

## Consent Form
Before we begin, it is essential for all participants to read and sign the consent form. This form outlines the details of the study, including your rights and our commitment to your privacy and data protection.

## Pre-Study Survey

Please take a moment to fill out the pre-study survey. This survey is designed to gather initial information about your background and coding proficiency, which is crucial for our research analysis.

## Experiment Setup
The experiment is divided into the following parts:

### Video Presentation
Watch a video from YouTube about Computer Science concept `Dynamic Sliding Window`.

### Coding Task
After watching the video, you will be asked to solve a related LeetCode-style coding problem using only traditional online resources such as Java documentation, Stack Overflow, GitHub, etc.

### Task Guidelines
- Thoroughly read and understand the coding task question prompt.
- Feel free to ask any clarifying questions.
- You will have a 30-minute window to complete each task.
- Your screen will be recorded during the task.
- Test cases will be provided for you to use in debugging your code.
- Please do not use Large language models like Chat-GPT.

## Watch the Video
